Drop
====

Drop is the game of the libgdx tutorial, improved with some features.
The original tutorial can be found here:
https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/wiki/A-simple-game

Improvements
========
I was trying to understand how Libgdx works, and added:
* Rocks, that if catched will be count as drops lost;
* A loseScreen witch is activated when 3 drops are lost;
* Record, it save your best score in the device (browser/phone/desktop).
